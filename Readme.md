# JUMPER

This tool has been created for helping developers out with daily docker routines. Once you configured the jumper file for a project, you can call easily run basic docker commands for any registered project and jump into main docker container using just `jumper b`.

I was inspired by [Mark's Shust](https://github.com/markshust/docker-magento) solutution for M2. Many thanks to Mark from my side for his ideas.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/asannikov/jumper.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/asannikov/jumper)

It was not tested on Windows.

# WHAT THIS TOOL CAN DO?
common things:
* enter to main defined container
* run docker project from any path of your local machine.
* container management (start/stop/restart)
* stop all containers

PHP
* run composer install/update with/without memory constraint
* run composer commands

@todo
* xDebug on/off 
* mysqldump
* file sync
* redis and varnish management
* Magento2 command support
* Laravel artisan support
* Docker extended managment
* GIT routines
* Extendable jumper config options
* Kubernetes management

I'll highly appreciate for testing and any ideas where this tool can be useful. Please, write your suggestions or your experience in the issues.

# HOW IT WORKS?
Once you call `jumper`, it looks for the `jumper.json` file in the current path where you are at this moment. 

Case1:

if the file `jumper.json` exists, it checks if the main container defined. If not, you will be asked to select the related container. IMPORTANT: docker project has to be run to select the related container. It's necessary once until container name is changed.
If main container has been defined already, it runs the related command, ie start docker project.

Case2:

if the file `jumper.json` does not exists, you will be asked to select the existing project or create a new one. You set the path to the project and select main container. After that `jumper.json` will be created in the defined project path. Besides, `.jumper.json` will be created in the user's path. It contains the list of created projects and is used for cli dialog when you want to select the project that you want to work with.

## Requirements 
- go1.13.x - go1.15.x

## Install
#### 1. Using Go
 - Please follow the link "[How to install go](https://golang.org/doc/install)".
 - Clone project to your custom directory `git clone https://github.com/asannikov/jumper.git`
 - Find the path to user's go folder `go env GOPATH` and copy it for the next command
 - Edit the file `~/.bash_profile` or `~/.zshrc` depending on enviroment and add/edit the the variables (This is an example path for Mac OS. Change the paths for Linux or Windows on your own):
 ```
export GOPATH="/Users/username/go" 
export GOROOT="/usr/local/bin/go"
export PATH=$PATH:$GOROOT/bin:$GOPATH/bin
 ```
 - run `. ~/.zshrc` or `source ~/.bash_profile`
 - Go to jumper project path and run `go install`
 

Now you can call `jumper` in any folder.

#### 2. Using brew (for Mac OS only, does not work yet)
 - install brew
 ```
 /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
 ```
 - run `brew install jumper`

# FAQ
## How to run bash commands inside container:
```jumper clirootnotty bash -c "cd src && ls"```

## How to hide long copyright text:
```$ jumper copyright disable```

You accept terms of the agreement the by doing this.

## How to add custom command:
Find method getCommandList in `commands.go` and write any custom method, ie:
`command.CustomMethod()`

getCommandList function has 2 parameters:
- c - config, contains general configuration and config for the current project.
- d - dialog, is used for communication with user, select container, remove file, etc.
- initf - function, that has to be called inside your command if you are going to interact with the config file or docker project.

## How to add extra config to project json file:
Add new project fields here `config/ProjectConfig.go` 
and add the related method to `config/config.go`, ie:
```
// SaveContainerNameToProjectConfig saves container name into project file
func (c *Config) SaveContainerNameToProjectConfig(cn string) (err error) {
	c.projectConfig.MainContainer = cn
	return c.fileSystem.SaveConfigFile(c.projectConfig, c.getProjectFile())
}

// GetProjectMainContainer gets project main container
func (c *Config) GetProjectMainContainer() string {
	return c.projectConfig.GetMainContainer()
}
```

## How to add custom option to GlobalConfig:
global config is visible only in `config/config.go` scope. Follows these steps to create custom options:

1. Add json field into `GlobalConfig` type in `globalConfig.go`.
2. Add new methods for new option handling in `globalConfig.go`.
3. Add duplicated methods in `config/config.go`.
4. Inject your logic inside the code, see ie Copyright methods: `EnableCopyright/DisableCopyright/ShowCopyrightText`
